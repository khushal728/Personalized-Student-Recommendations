# Personalized-Student-Recommendations

Project Overview

This project aims to develop a personalized recommendation system for students based on their academic performance, preferences, and learning behavior. The system will recommend courses, study materials, and extracurricular activities tailored to the individual needs of each student. The goal is to enhance the learning experience, boost engagement, and support students in their academic and personal development.

Setup Instructions

Follow the steps below to set up the project locally:

1. Clone the Repository
First, clone this repository to your local machine using Git:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/personalized-student-recommendations.git
2. Navigate to the Project Directory
Move into the project directory:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd personalized-student-recommendations
3. Create a Virtual Environment
It's recommended to create a virtual environment to manage dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
python -m venv venv
4. Activate the Virtual Environment
On Windows:
bash
Copy
Edit
venv\Scripts\activate
On macOS/Linux:
bash
Copy
Edit
source venv/bin/activate
5. Install Dependencies
Install the required Python packages listed in the requirements.txt file:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
6. Run the Project
Once all dependencies are installed, you can run the application or script depending on your setup. For example:

bash
Copy
Edit
python main.py
This will start the recommendation system.

7. Optional: Set Up the Database
If the project uses a database (such as SQLite or PostgreSQL), follow the instructions in the Database Setup section to configure the database.

Approach Description
The personalized student recommendation system follows these key steps:

1. Data Collection
Academic Data: Information about student grades, courses completed, and performance.
Student Preferences: Data regarding the student's interests, study habits, and extracurricular activities.
Behavioral Data: Interaction data such as time spent on study materials, attendance, etc.
2. Data Preprocessing
Clean and normalize the data to ensure consistency and remove any missing or irrelevant values.
Use feature engineering to create meaningful attributes that will help improve the model's recommendations (e.g., converting categorical features into numerical ones).
3. Modeling Approach
Collaborative Filtering: Use collaborative filtering to recommend courses or activities based on similar students’ behavior.
Content-Based Filtering: Recommend materials or activities that match the student’s preferences and past performance.
Hybrid Approach: Combine both collaborative and content-based filtering for more accurate recommendations.
4. Recommendation Algorithm
Use algorithms such as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) or Matrix Factorization (e.g., Singular Value Decomposition) to compute personalized recommendations for students.
Optimize the model using metrics like Precision, Recall, and F1-score to ensure that the recommendations are relevant and useful.
5. Evaluation
Evaluate the system using a cross-validation approach and analyze the effectiveness of the recommendations.
Provide a user interface or API where students can receive their personalized recommendations.
6. Deployment
Deploy the recommendation system as a web application or integrate it into an existing Learning Management System (LMS).
Use tools like Flask or Django for the web interface and Heroku or AWS for hosting the system.
